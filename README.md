Welcome to my Employment Data Analytics project!

In this project, I will be analyzing a dataset containing information about salaries for the employees of the City and County of San Francisco. The dataset contains over 150,000 records, including employee job title, department, and compensation information.

My goals for this project are to identify patterns and trends in the data, and provide insights into the compensation practices of the city government. I will be utilizing various analytical techniques such as data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.

I hope that my work in this project will provide valuable insights into the employment practices of the City and County of San Francisco and help us make data-driven decisions to improve equity and fairness in compensation.
